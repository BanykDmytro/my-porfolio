    <h2><b>Jett's story</b></h2>
    <p class="Jetts-story">Soo Han is a girl from South Korea, possibly from the Insadong area in Seoul. She used to be a chef, but a terrible accident happened in her restaurant because of her uncontrollable powers. The restaurant was destroyed, and she ran away.
Later, Soo Han joined the VALORANT Protocol organization and became an agent named <b>Jett</b>.
During a mission in Venice, there was an explosion, and someone who looked like Jett was blamed. Although the real Jett was innocent, many people saw her as a threat.
It was later revealed that the culprit was her double from another universe. All accusations against Jett were dropped, but because of the organization's secrecy, few people believed her. To ordinary people, she is still a dangerous Radiant.
Unlike her evil copy, the real Jett is considered a hero among Radiants, as shown by statues and special cards.
